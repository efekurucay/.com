## Overview

Fibiyo is a comprehensive e-commerce platform designed to offer a rich shopping experience for customers and enable sellers to list and sell their products. The project is developed with a modern backend architecture (Spring Boot) and a reactive frontend (Angular). It incorporates innovative features such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities (image generation, review summarization), a short video integration called "Feels," and a subscription system.

## Key Features

- **üîê User Management & Authorization**
  Registration, login, password reset, and secure JWT-based authentication. Role-based authorization for three different user roles: Customer, Seller, and Admin.

- **üì¶ Product & Category Management**
  A hierarchical category structure, full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for sellers, and a product approval system for admins.

- **üõí E-Commerce Core**
  Shopping cart, wishlist, discount coupon application, and a multi-step order creation process.

- **üí≥ Payments & Subscriptions**
  Secure payment system integrated with Stripe. Subscription plans offering advanced features for both sellers and customers.

- **üé• "Feels" Video Feature**
  An innovative marketing tool allowing sellers to upload short promotional videos for their products, similar to social media reels.

  Specially designed management panels for administering users, products, orders, and viewing sales analytics.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Angular, TypeScript, SCSS, Angular Signals
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Java 17, Spring Security (JWT), Spring Data JPA
- **Database**: MySQL
- **API & Integrations**: Stripe (Payments), OpenAI/Gemini (AI Features), Jakarta Mail
- **Build Tools**: Maven, Angular CLI

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the most challenging aspects of the project was establishing a clean and scalable backend architecture incorporating Domain, Application, and Infrastructure layers. Integrating external APIs like Stripe and OpenAI required handling asynchronous operations, secure key management, and robust error-handling mechanisms. On the frontend, achieving a reactive and performant state management system using Angular Signals was a significant learning process. Ensuring end-to-end security for three distinct roles (Admin, Seller, Customer) was one of the key achievements of the project's security layer.

## Outcome

Fibiyo stands as a feature-rich, full-stack e-commerce platform that showcases a modern, layered architecture. It successfully integrates advanced features like AI-powered seller tools and the "Feels" video system, providing a solid foundation for a multi-user, multi-role online marketplace. The project serves as a comprehensive portfolio piece demonstrating the development of complex web applications with Spring Boot and Angular.
