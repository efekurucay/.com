## Overview

Fibiyo is a comprehensive e-commerce platform designed to offer a rich shopping experience for customers and enable sellers to list and sell their products. The project is developed with a modern backend architecture (Spring Boot) and a reactive frontend (Angular). It incorporates innovative features such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities (image generation, review summarization), a short video integration called "Feels," and a subscription system.

## Key Features

- **🔐 User Management & Authorization**
  Registration, login, password reset, and secure JWT-based authentication. Role-based authorization for three different user roles: Customer, Seller, and Admin.

- **📦 Product & Category Management**
  A hierarchical category structure, full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for sellers, and a product approval system for admins.

- **🛒 E-Commerce Core**
  Shopping cart, wishlist, discount coupon application, and a multi-step order creation process.

- **💳 Payments & Subscriptions**
  Secure payment system integrated with Stripe. Subscription plans offering advanced features for both sellers and customers.

- **🎥 "Feels" Video Feature**
  An innovative marketing tool allowing sellers to upload short promotional videos for their products, similar to social media reels.

- **🤖 AI-Powered Tools (For Sellers)**
  Generate product images from text prompts and automatically summarize product reviews to provide useful insights for buyers.

- **📊 Admin & Seller Dashboards**
  Specially designed management panels for administering users, products, orders, and viewing sales analytics.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Angular, TypeScript, SCSS, Angular Signals
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Java 17, Spring Security (JWT), Spring Data JPA
- **Database**: MySQL
- **API & Integrations**: Stripe (Payments), OpenAI/Gemini (AI Features), Jakarta Mail
- **Build Tools**: Maven, Angular CLI

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the most challenging aspects of the project was establishing a clean and scalable backend architecture incorporating Domain, Application, and Infrastructure layers. Integrating external APIs like Stripe and OpenAI required handling asynchronous operations, secure key management, and robust error-handling mechanisms. On the frontend, achieving a reactive and performant state management system using Angular Signals was a significant learning process. Ensuring end-to-end security for three distinct roles (Admin, Seller, Customer) was one of the key achievements of the project's security layer.

## Outcome

Fibiyo stands as a feature-rich, full-stack e-commerce platform that showcases a modern, layered architecture. It successfully integrates advanced features like AI-powered seller tools and the "Feels" video system, providing a solid foundation for a multi-user, multi-role online marketplace. The project serves as a comprehensive portfolio piece demonstrating the development of complex web applications with Spring Boot and Angular.
